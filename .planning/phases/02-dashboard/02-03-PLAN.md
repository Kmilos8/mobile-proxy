<objective>
Visual and functional verification of the complete dashboard redesign. The operator confirms that all Phase 2 success criteria are met: device fleet overview, connection creation, connection detail with credentials, responsive layout, and connection deletion.

Purpose: Human-in-the-loop verification that the automated implementation matches the visual and functional requirements before marking the phase complete.

Output: Verified dashboard ready for Phase 3.

  <name>Task 1: Verify complete dashboard redesign</name>
  <files>dashboard/src/app/devices/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Present the operator with the complete dashboard for visual and functional verification. Start the dev server with `cd dashboard && npm run dev` and guide the operator through the verification checklist below.

    What was built:
    - shadcn/ui component library (dark theme, Vercel/Linear aesthetic)
    - Collapsible sidebar with Devices-only navigation
    - Device fleet overview: stat bar (total/online/offline) + sortable/filterable table
    - Device detail page with connection management
    - Add Connection modal (HTTP/SOCKS5/OpenVPN)
    - Connection table with per-field credential copy and Copy All URL format
    - .ovpn download for OpenVPN connections
    - Delete connection with confirmation dialog
    - Responsive layout at 768px+

    Verification checklist:

    **1. Home page (/devices):**
    - Stat bar shows total, online, offline device counts
    - Device table has columns: Name, Status, IP, Connection Count
    - Click column header sorts the table (toggle asc/desc)
    - Status filter (All/Online/Offline) works
    - Offline devices are visually dimmed
    - Click a device row navigates to device detail

    **2. Sidebar:**
    - Shows only "Devices" nav item
    - Click toggle button collapses to icon-only mode
    - Collapsed state persists after page reload
    - Sign Out button works in both states

    **3. Device detail page (/devices/{id}):**
    - Connection table shows all connections with type, credentials, status
    - Per-field copy buttons work (host, port, username, password)
    - "Copy All" copies URL format (e.g., socks5://user:pass@host:port)
    - Click "Add Connection" opens modal
    - Create HTTP, SOCKS5, and OpenVPN connections
    - OpenVPN .ovpn download works
    - Delete connection with confirmation works

    **4. Responsive (resize browser to 768px wide):**
    - No horizontal scroll, sidebar collapses, tables readable

    **5. Visual:**
    - Dark theme throughout, clean monochrome aesthetic

    **6. /overview redirects to /devices**

    Resume signal: Type "approved" if everything looks good, or describe specific issues to fix.
  </action>
  <verify>Operator completes all checklist items and types "approved"</verify>
  <done>All Phase 2 success criteria confirmed by operator visual inspection</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All five Phase 2 success criteria from ROADMAP verified by operator:
1. Operator can see all devices with online/offline status, current IP, carrier, battery, and signal strength
2. Operator can create a new proxy connection (HTTP, SOCKS5, or OpenVPN) from the dashboard and immediately see credentials
3. Operator can view a connection detail page showing host, port, username, password, and .ovpn download with one-click copy
4. Dashboard layout is usable on desktop and tablet (no horizontal scroll, no broken layouts at 768px+)
5. Operator can delete a proxy connection and the port is freed

<success_criteria>
Operator types "approved" confirming all checklist items pass.
</success_criteria>
